One of the issues when looking into developing
fingerprinting is finding the best algorithm or
mix of algorithms to extract and match features
in fingerprints. This is known as fusion
algorithms, this is where our project aims to
solve and answer the benefits and ways of
improving singular feature extraction matching
algorithms by pairing the two feature extractors
together to get a deeper understanding of how
fingerprinting algorithms work and where they
are able to show their strengths as well as
weaknesses. Firstly we review existing
algorithms and approaches to implement our
singleton algorithms for local, global, and ridge
based feature extractors. After that we then
research and find algorithms for fusion matching
algorithms that utilize pairs of these algorithms
to have as a comparison point. After researching
we start implementation for image
pre-processing which will be consistent for all
our matching algorithms as a base line and our
findings will use the FCV 2000 DB, specifically
the 2000 DB3 database for fingerprints, which
was mainly used for testing.
